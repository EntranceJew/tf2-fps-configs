# tf2-fps-configs
These are mostly things that aren't mine but I want to keep track of.

These come from [comanglia's fps configs](http://www.teamfortress.tv/25328/comanglia-s-config-fps-guide) but I also broke gfx.cfg into reloadable parts using [this thread](http://www.teamfortress.tv/11230).
I create duplicate lines for the "exec" command by putting an echo in front of it. Disregard any echos made when saving / loading.
Changing these mid-game will re-execute all options and potentially freeze your game for 15 seconds at least.

**Warning**: Any changes made via settings regarding which config file is executed will have to be put in `autoexec.cfg` to be made permanent. Executable lists and dropdowns don't save, unfortunately.
